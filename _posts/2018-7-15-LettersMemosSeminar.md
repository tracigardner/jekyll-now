<p>Correspondence is a critical form of technical writing. In addition to email messages, which we covered in <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/EmailSeminar" target="_blank">last week&rsquo;s #SundaySeminar</a>, you need to know how to write letters and memos—and the difference between the two.</p>
<h2 id="letters">Letters</h2>
<p>Most of the time, the workplace letters you write will be  <strong>formal letters</strong>. You will use letters for things such as job applications, official requests to someone inside or outside your organization,  documentation of complaints and reprimands, and recognition of special achievements. Here are some more specific examples that you are likely to see early in your career: </p>
<ul>
  <li>cover letters that are part of a job application packet. </li>
  <li>thank you letters to those who are part of your job search (e.g., interviewers, HR staff, those who write recommendations).</li>
  <li>recommendation letters for those you work with.</li>
  <li>cover letters (or transmittal letters) that accompany reports and proposals.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, you will want a formal letter. You may occasionally write <strong>informal letters</strong> in the workplace, but it’s typical for informal correspondence to be handled in email messages.</p>
<p>These resources can help no matter which kind of letter you are writing: </p>

</ul>
<h2 id="memos">Memos</h2>
<p>When you are not writing letters or email messages, you will often find yourself writing memos, which are typically internal messages sent to colleagues within your organization. </p>
<p>Like all correspondence, memos should be clear and well-organized with document design features that help readers find the information that is important to them. You can use headings, bulleted lists, and numbered lists to make details stand out.</p>
<p>In addition to general memos, you may find that you use specific memos in the workplace. For instance, you might use a <strong>memorandum of understanding</strong> (MoU) as a kind of contract, where you and other parties agree to specific terms. MoUs are often created by a lawyer or the organization’s legal department. If you write such a memo yourself, it will probably need to go through a legal review before it is sent to the recipient.</p>

<h2 id="kinds">Kinds of Correspondence</h2>
<h3 id="good-news">Good News Messages</h3>
<p>Good-news messages are usually easy to write. At worst, your reader may be neutral about the information that you are sharing. In many situations, your reader may be pleased or even overjoyed, which makes your job as the writer simpler.</p>
<p>Even though they are easier, good-news messages do require a specific organization. Most importantly, you want to be sure that you don’t bury your good news. Put it right up front!</p>
<p>These resources show you how to share the good news:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/152hRhl_x60" target="_blank">Writing An Effective Good-News Message</a> (1m21s), from tulsaccprof on YouTube, gives you the basics.</li>
<li><a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/present-good-news-business-memo-39908.html" target="_blank">How to Present Good News in a Business Memo</a>, from the Small Business section of the Houston Chronicle website, explains that your message should be &ldquo;direct and to-the-point, including only a brief introductory or background section, a clear statement of the good news and precise instructions for any required employee follow-on actions.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="bad-news">Bad News Messages</h3>
<p>Few people want to receive bad news. Likewise, unless we’re talking about the Wicked Witch of the West, Voldemort, or Darth Vader, most people are uncomfortable when they have to give someone bad news. The challenge is to write a bad new message that gets the point across without alienating the reader.</p>
 <p>Typically, bad news messages begin with some kind of “buffer” that cushions the negative information. This indirect approach allows you to break the news gently to your reader. There are times, however, when a more direct approach is appropriate, such as in an emergency situation or when the bad news is expected.</p>

 <li><a href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/present-bad-news-business-memo-39646.html" target="_blank">How to Present Bad News in a Business Memo</a>, presents the opposite perspective from the Houston Chronicle piece above.
