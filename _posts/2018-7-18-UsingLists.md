<p>Today’s discussion post focuses on organizing information in your professional writing by using lists. Bullet lists and numbered lists make related information easy to read through; further, because they are offset from the margins, lists stand out and catch the reader’s eye. Consider this example of a text written in a paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="font-size:normal;padding: 21px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">How To Fill Out Form I-765</h2>
<p style="font-size:small;padding: 0px 21px 0px 21px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 21px;margin-right: 21px;">Type or print legibly in black ink. If extra space is needed to complete any item, attach a continuation sheet, write your name and Alien Registration Number (A-Number) (if any), at the top of each sheet of paper, indicate the Part and item number to which your answer refers, and date and sign each sheet. Answer all questions fully and accurately. State that an item is not applicable with “N/A.” If the answer is none, write “None.”</p>
<p style="font-size:small;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 21px;margin-right: 21px;text-align: right;">—From <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/files/form/i-765instr.pdf" target="_blank">Instructions for Application for Employment Authorization</a>, <br />
Department of Homeland Security</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can read through the information, but it could be better with the right formatting. Compare the paragraph version above to this revision, which uses numbered lists: </p>
<blockquote>
<h2 style="font-size:normal;padding: 21px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 0px;">How To Fill Out Form I-765</h2>
<ol style="font-size:small;padding: 0px 21px 0px 45px;margin-top: 0px;margin-bottom: 21px;margin-right: 21px;">
<li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Type or print legibly in black ink.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">If extra space is needed to complete any item
  <ol>
    <li>Attach a continuation sheet</li>
    <li>Write your name and Alien Registration  Number (A-Number) (if any), at the top of each sheet of paper</li>
    <li>Indicate the Part and item number to which your  answer refers, </li>
    <li> Date and sign each sheet.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 9px;">Answer all questions fully and accurately. State that an item is not applicable with &ldquo;N/A.&rdquo; If the answer is none, write &ldquo;None.&rdquo; </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be immediately obvious that the version with the lists is easier to read. It provides a structure that works well with the <a href="/fridayfact-f-shaped-reading-pattern/" target="_blank">F-shaped reading pattern</a>. </p>
<p>I have two resources that you should read to learn more about using lists: </p>
<ol class="listDS">
  <li>Read all four pages of Grammar Girl’s <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/formatting-vertical-lists" target="_blank">Formatting Vertical Lists</a> (or listen to the podcast). The information will tell you when to use a colon with a list, whether to capitalize list items. how to use other punctuation, and why list items should be parallel.</li>
  <li>Read <a href="http://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills/bulleted-numbered-lists" target="_blank">Bulleted &amp; Numbered Lists</a> from the University of Minnesota’s Accessible U. This resource will tell you how to format your lists so that they work well with screenreaders and other assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>For your comment on this post, find a short passage from your proposal draft that would benefit from being revised as a list. Show us your before and after versions in a comment.</p>
