<p>The Discussion posts this week provide more information about proposals. Some of the information, like today’s tutorial, include information that expands beyond the basic details you need to write your short proposal for this class. Since you are likely to write  more than one kind of proposal once you enter the workforce, the thorough details in this video are sure to  come in handy</p>
<p>Today’s #TuesdayTutorial, the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Communication-tutorials/overview-proposal-writing/182920/410240-4.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">Lynda.com video Overview of Business Proposals</a></span> (5m25s),  introduces four different types of proposals and goes on to discuss common proposal characteristics such as document structure, the necessary length, and audience needs. </p>
<p>As you watch the video, consider how the information relates to the short proposal that you will write. Since you will write about different kind of writing and for different reasons, how can you apply the information the video shares? If you have experience writing proposals in the workplace or elsewhere, how does your experience match the information in the video?</p>
