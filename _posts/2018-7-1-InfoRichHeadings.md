<p>Todayâ€™s #FridayFact discusses how including clear headings, subheadings, and links helps readers navigate your document by providing information-rich signposts. Listen for a reference in the video to the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/FShapedReadingPattern/" target="_blank">F-shaped reading pattern</a>, which these document features support.</p>
<p>The video refers to online documents specifically, but most of these  features are useful in printed documents as well. Obviously links are not very helpful in printed work. Headings and subheadings certainly are.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom:10px;margin-top:0px;">From the course <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Web-Content-Strategy-tutorials/Writing-Web/180104-2.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">Learning to Write for the Web</a> by Chris Nodder (video, 5m22s)</p>

<p>For additional information, this <a href="http://writing.umn.edu/tww/discipline/business/Ba3033act2.pdf" target="_blank">resource from the University of Minnesota</a> shows the differences between generic category headings, descriptive headings, and informative headings. As you examine the three kinds of headings, think about how you can apply this fact to your proposal.</p>
