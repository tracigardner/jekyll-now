<p>One of my favorite ways to talk about strong document design is the CRAP method. CRAP stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. Using all four of these elements helps give your work a polished appearance and catches readers&#8217; attention. </p>
<p>This week&#8217;s #InfographicInspiration (<a href="https://paper-leaf.com/blog/2012/10/principles-of-design-quick-reference-poster/">from Paper Leaf Designs</a>)Â gives you a quick overview of all four elements. Apply it to your professional biography assignment before you turn it in on Monday.</p>
<p>For a more detailed explanation of the CRAP elements, watch the Lynda.com video, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Understanding-PARC-system/145210/170193-4.html" target="_blank">Understanding the PARC system</a> (Lynda.com was apparently afraid to say CRAP, so they spell it backwards. I think you&rsquo;re more likely to remember &ldquo;CRAP&rdquo;).</p>
