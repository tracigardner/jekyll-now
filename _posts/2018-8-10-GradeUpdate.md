<h2>What’s Done</h2>
<p>I have graded everything that has been submitted up to this point (4AM on Friday, August 10). </p>
<h2>What’s Left to Do (and When)</h2>
<p>I will grade any grace period submissions Friday night and Saturday night, and I will grade the final exams on Sunday evening. </p>
<h2>Canvas and Your Course Grade</h2>
<p>Once all of the final exams have been submitted, I will change the grade book to indicate that your Final Exam grade is 100% of your course grade. Doing this will allow me to upload your course grades to the Registrar. </p>
<p>From your perspective, this change means that whatever you see as the grade for your Final Exam is also the grade you have earned in the course.</p>
<p>I will post an Announcement on Canvas when all of the finals have been graded, which should certainly be by Monday.</p>
