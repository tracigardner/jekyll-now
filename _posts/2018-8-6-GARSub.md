<h2 id="tasks">Tasks for Today</h2>
<ol class="listDS">
<li><strong>Work through the assignment checklist</strong> before submitting your Proposal:
<ul class="listDS">
<li>Does your document make a <strong>good first impression</strong>? Does it look polished and professional?</li>
<li>Confirm that the draft includes the <strong>required sections</strong> (additional sections are okay):
<ul class="null">
  <li>cover page (be sure to list your name as the author)</li>
  <li>executive summary (or abstract)</li>
  <li>table of contents</li>
  <li>introduction</li>
  <li>methods</li>
  <li>results (or findings)</li>
  <li>conclusions</li>
  <li>references (your sources and documentation)</li>
  <li>appendix (where your full examples of the genre go—weblinks to examples are also acceptable)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Does your document <strong>use quotation marks, in-text citations, and bibliography entries</strong> for any ideas, words, phrases, or structures that are not your own writing? Remember that all borrowed information must be documented. If you need a review, watch the Lynda.com video <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/How-identify-credit-sources/373553/549315-4.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">How to identify and credit sources</a> (6m 32s).</li>
<li>Does your document <strong>use lists</strong> to organize information and make it easy to read (if appropriate)? See <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/UsingLists/" target="_blank">#WednesdayWrite: Using Lists to Organize Information post</a>.</li>
<li>Does your documents use <strong>headings and subheadings</strong> to help the reader find information in the proposal? See <a href="http://tracigardner.github.io//InfoRichHeadings/" target="_blank">#FridayFact: Information-Rich Signposts Help Readers</a>.</li>
<li>Does your document take advantage of the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/CRAPdesign/" target="_blank">CRAP design principles</a>?
<ul class="null">
<li>Does the document use <strong>contrast</strong> to make key text (like the title) stand out?</li>
<li>Does the document use <strong>repetition</strong> so that the document is consistent and unified?</li>
<li>Does the document use <strong>alignment</strong> to connect the different sections and ensure nothing seems out of place?</li>
<li>Does the document use <strong>proximity</strong> to emphasize organization by keeping related information together?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does the document use <strong>accurate/appropriate</strong> grammar, spelling, punctuation, mechanics, linking, and formatting? For a refresher on grammar and punctuation basics, watch the Lynda.com courses on <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Business-Skills-tutorials/Grammar-Fundamentals/158318-2.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">Grammar Fundamentals</a> and <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Skills-tutorials/Advanced-Grammar/373556-2.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">Advanced Grammar</a>.</li>
