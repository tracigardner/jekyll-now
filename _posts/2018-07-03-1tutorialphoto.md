<p>The <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/assignments/442797" target="_parent">Professional Bio Statement</a> that you are working on for your first major project needs a professional photo that shows readers both what you look like and something about your personality and style. I know that none of you would use a bathroom mirror selfie, but based on what students have submitted in the past, I want to provide some specific guidelines.</p>
<h2>What to Wear</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Wear the kind of clothes that you would wear to work or to an interview. Be professional.</li>
  <li>Alternately, if you are using a photo that shows yourself at work, the clothes that you wear in the workplace are fine (e.g., no one expects someone working a construction site to wear a suit). Just be sure that the job matches your career ambitions.</li>
  <li>If you are pursuing a military career or currently in the Corps, a photo in your uniform works for this assignment. </li>
  <li>Don’t use a photo in which you are wearing formalwear. Ring Dance, prom, or wedding photos of you in a tux or evening gown are not  appropriate. Your readers will know you are trying to make-do with a photo that was clearly for another purpose. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Choose Your Setting</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Take your photo in a neutral location or in the kind of workplace where you hope to be employed. For instance, a photo on a construction site would be fine if you're a building construction major. </li>
  <li>Alternately, take your photo in a location that relates to your career. If you are a planning to be a veterinarian, you can take a photo with your horse in the stable or outside with your dog.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Eliminate Distractions</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Be sure there is nothing unusual in the background of your photo. Check for anything that is out of place. You want your readers to focus on you, not the background.</li>
  <li>Ensure that the photo focuses on you. Your significant other and friends do not belong in the photo. Crop out anything that doesn’t belong.</li>
  <li>Beware of phantom body parts from others in a photo. Don’t use a photo that shows someone else’s hand on your shoulder, for instance.</li>
</ul>
