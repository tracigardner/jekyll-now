<p>You may find that you have an Incomplete for one of the assignments required to earn a B in the course. FYI, all of those assignments are listed in the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/GradeTutorial/" target="_blank">#TuesdayTutorial: Determining Your Course Grade</a>.</p>
<p>If you are in this situation, here’s what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Take a deep breath. You are not doomed. You are in the same kind of situation as someone in the workplace who didn&rsquo;t win a bid or lost a client. There&rsquo;s still hope.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Turn your attention to your <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/assignments/442794" target="_parent">final exam</a>. As you explain the grade that you deserve in the course, explain what happened with any assignments that earned an Incomplete. Account for what went wrong, and convince me that you&rsquo;ll deal more effectively with such situations in the future.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Focus on making your final exam persuasive by using these tips:
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Pay attention to the advice in the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/GradeTutorial/" target="_blank">#TuesdayTutorial: Determining Your Course Grade</a>.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Use what you know about document design. Remember the value of chunking information, using information-rich headings, and making your document easy to navigate. Don&rsquo;t make me (your audience) search for information. Use document design strategies that show me where everything is.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Consider adding tables or graphs that support your argument. Be sure that any graphics you include add to the content. Don&rsquo;t toss in clipart or other graphics just as decorations. Be sure your graphics help you make your point.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Provide concrete data on your performance. Use numbers, facts, and even quotations from your work or feedback. Show me how you have done in the course. Make everything completely obvious.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Remember to spellcheck and proofread. It&rsquo;s important to your argument that your document is polished and professional. Errors will make your point less persuasive.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Be sure that you clearly state the grade you argue you deserve in the course. Don’t make me guess!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
