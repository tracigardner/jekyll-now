  <li>Does your document make a <strong>good first impression</strong>? Does it look polished and professional?</li>

      <li>Does it describe the characteristics and special features of each kind of writing?</li>
      <li>Does it provide links to any textbook explanations or advice articles?</li>

      <li>Does it identify ethical issues and/or intercultural and global issues that can impact the different kinds of writing? (one or the other or both)</li>

      <li>Does the document use <strong>repetition</strong> so that the document is consistent and unified?</li>
      <li>Does the document use <strong>alignment</strong> to connect the different sections and ensure nothing seems out of place?</li>
