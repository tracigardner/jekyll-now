<p><em>This is the post for August 2, 2018.</em></p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes for Today</h2>
As a reminder, we’re using a different schedule this week. Your Genre Analysis Report (GAR) is due Monday, August 6, so you need to spend this week giving your report all your attention. Here's how it will be different:
  <ul>
  <li>No additional textbook readings or daily discussion posts this week.</li>
  <li>Only one Course Declaration for the entire week (rather than one every day).</li>
  </ul>
<h2 id="readings">Readings for Today</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Review what you’ve read as necessary. Find the links in Step 2 of the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/assignments/442795" target="_parent">GAR Assignment</a>.</li>
  <li>Review any relevant daily discussion posts by visiting the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/PostList/" target="_blank">list of all posts</a>.</li>
  </ul>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks for Today</h2>
<ol class="listDS">
<li><strong>Finish the draft of your GAR.</strong>
  <ul>
  <li>Make your draft as complete as possible. </li>
  <li>If there are places where you know you will make changes or add information, add a note in your draft. </li>
  <li>Likewise, if there are places where you have questions, mark those as well and tell readers what you need help with.</li>
  </ul></li>
<li><strong>By 11:59PM tonight (Thursday, August 2), post a rough draft</strong> of your GAR to your Writing Group in Canvas in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/discussion_topics/362553" target="_parent">Group Feedback on Genre Analysis Reports discussion in Canvas</a>. Additional instructions are in the Discussion.</li>
<li><strong>By 11:59PM on Friday, August 3, post feedback in Canvas to all your group members</strong> in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/discussion_topics/362553" target="_parent">Group Feedback on Genre Analysis Reports discussion in Canvas</a>. Remember to provide constructive feedback. Since these are longer projects, you will need to allow extra time.</li>
