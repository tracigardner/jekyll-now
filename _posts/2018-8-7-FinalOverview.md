  <li>This is the last post of work for the course.</li>
  <li>You have the rest of the week to complete your final exam and any other outstanding work.</li>
  <li>There is no peer review for your Final Exam. Sharing your draft would violate your privacy, since it would mean sharing your grades.</li>
</ul>
