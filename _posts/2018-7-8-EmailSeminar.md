<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/perfectemail-912x1024.jpg" alt="Anatomy of a Perfect Business Email" style="width: 500px;height: 561px;margin: 9px;float: right;" />Our #SundaySeminar posts give you resources on important topics that are not covered anywhere else in the course. Additionally, you can save these links to use later in the workplace. Today, I have some links that will help you write email messages that get read (and accomplish your goals).</p>
<ul class="listDS">
<li>The <em>Inside Higher Ed</em> article “<a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/04/16/advice-students-so-they-dont-sound-silly-emails-essay" target="_blank">Re: Your Recent Email to Your Professor</a>” outlines tips for how to write email messages that persuade your professors to help you.</li>
<li><a href="https://withoutbullshit.com/blog/10-tips-effective-email-infographic" target="_blank">10 Tips for Effective Email</a> (from a website with a slightly off-color name) clearly and concisely outlines specific ways to improve your email messages with an easy-to-understand infographic.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.inc.com/sujan-patel/10-pointless-and-unnecessary-phrases-you-keep-including-in-emails.html" target="_blank">10 Pointless Phrases You Keep Including in Emails</a> is a quick overview of ways to strengthen your messages for U.S. readers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dailymuse/2014/11/18/27-pre-written-templates-for-your-toughest-work-emails/#409357da182f" target="_blank">27 Pre-Written Templates For Your Toughest Work Emails</a> will help you with situations like saying no when you need to.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a bonus, you can also consult the infographic on the right, which outlines the parts that comprise a perfect business email message: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Subject Line</li>
  <li>Greeting</li>
  <li>Introduction</li>
  <li>Main Body</li>
  <li>Closing Remarks</li>
  <li>Closing Signature</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending upon the purpose and audience of your message, the length of these sections will vary. There’s no reason to pad your message out for a short request, for instance. Adding extraneous information in that way just buries the point you are trying to make. Use common sense.</p>
