<ul class="listDS">
   <li><strong>Heavy readings listed today.</strong> I have listed readings that you can use to find the information to fill out your analysis table. Since you all have other obligations, I wanted to give you all the materials at the beginning of the project so that you can plan your work through the week.</li>
   <li><strong> Please do not feel that you have to read everything today.</strong> Read what you need to as you need to have a draft of your analysis table ready to share with your group on Thursday, July 12.</li>
