<ul class="listDS">
   <li><strong>Fridays are work days.</strong> Every Friday in this course, you will have a major project underway, which will usually be due on the following Monday. To ensure you have time to work with your writing group and finish your draft, Fridays will focus primarily on reminding you of the resources that are available and providing some additional resources to help you do your best work.</li>
   <li><strong>What major work is not due on a Monday?</strong> Your final exam is due on the last day of the term (August 11), which is a Saturday.</li></ul>
