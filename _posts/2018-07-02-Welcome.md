<p>Welcome to Technical Writing. This is the course website for English 3764 (Technical Writing), CRN #70953, taught by Traci Gardner at Virginia Tech during Summer II Semester 2018.</p>
<p>Information on all assignments, weekly activities, and related resources for these courses will be posted on this Canvas home page. Check this site daily for the details on what to do for the course.</p>
<h2>Notes for Today</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
   <li><strong>Work Hours:</strong> Normally, I am online from late afternoon through early morning hours. I&rsquo;m not a morning person. So look for responses from me during those hours.</li>
   <li><strong>Web Design Work:</strong> I am working to convert the content for the courses that I teach from a WordPress blog to a GitHub Pages site. While I have been working for weeks, the conversion is still incomplete. You may notice some oddities on the Canvas site (like repeated titles and pages that don't scroll to the top), because I have used iframes to include information from outside sites. (Yes, web dev folks, I know that iframes suck, but Canvas isn't very flexible.) Know that I am working to improve things.</li>

<h2>Tasks for Today</h2>
 <ol class="listDS">
   <li><a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/modules" target="_blank"><strong>Complete the Course Overview Module in Canvas.</strong></a> You will read the various course documents and then take a <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/quizzes/110232" target="_blank">syllabus verification quiz</a>. The quiz is due by 11:59PM Tuesday, July 3. The grace period for the quiz ends at 11:59PM Friday, July 6.</li>
   <li><strong>Ask any questions you have</strong> about the course materials in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/discussion_topics/362552">General Q&A about the Course Discussion</a>. Check this forum for answers as well. If you know the answer to a question, feel free to tell your classmates. Obviously, asking questions is optional.</li>
   <li><strong>Confirm that your notifications in Canvas are set</strong> the way you want them. Note that Canvas uses your notification preferences to determine whether to email you or text you (or not tell you at all) about information on the site. See the section &quot;<a href="https://vt4help.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010590#notification" target="_blank">How do I adjust my notification preferences?</a>&quot; in the <a title="Student Getting Started with Canvas Guide" href="https://vt4help.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB0010590" target="_blank">Student Getting Started with Canvas Guide</a> for more information on setting up your notifications. </li>
   <li><strong>Add a professional profile picture to your Canvas account.</strong> Follow the <a href="https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2863" target="_blank">Canvas documentation to add a profile picture</a> in your user account. Since this is an online course, your profile picture helps me see you as more than just a name on the course roll.</li>
   <li><strong>Fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/16gNHgFHO4gzlbrA3" target="_blank">Summer II 2018 Group Preferences Survey</a></strong> so that I can arrange your writing groups. Responses are due by 11:59PM Tuesday, July 3. If you cannot fill out the survey on time, you may be placed in a general group or your group placement may be delayed. We will begin using groups later this week.</li>
