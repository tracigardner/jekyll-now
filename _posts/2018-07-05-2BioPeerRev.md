<p><em>This is the post for July 5, 2018.</em></p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes for Today</h2>
<ul class="listDS">
   <li><strong>Writing Groups Set Up.</strong> There are four groups of five people each:
   <ul class="null">
   <li>Evening 1</li>
   <li>Evening 2</li>
   <li>Morning</li>
   <li>No Preference</li>
   </ul>
   Two of you indicated that you were late-night workers. Since two is not enough for a separate group, I added you to the Evening groups.
   </li>
   <li><strong>Change Your Group Name, if you want.</strong> The group names are fairly unimaginative. If your group wants to change the name, decide in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/discussion_topics/362556" target="_blank">Group Ground Rules Discussion in Canvas</a>. When you have a new name decided, have one member of your group email me (tengrrl@vt.edu) with the old name and the new name.</li>
   <li><strong>How Group Discussion Works.</strong> Canvas keeps track of you and your group members. When you go to a group Discussion (like the peer review Discussion), you will automatically be with the members of your group.</li>
   <li><strong>Not in a Group?</strong> If you are not in a group, you have added the class recently. Let me know, and I will add you to a group as soon as you show up in Canvas.</li>
</ul>

      <li>The <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/good-linkedin-summary-with-examples-4126809" target="_blank">LinkedIn Summary article</a>. Your professional bio, with light revision, can frequently do double duty as the summary for your LinkedIn profile.</li>

    <li>If there are places where you know you will make changes or add information, add a note in your draft. </li>
    <li>Likewise, if there are places where you have questions, mark those as well and tell readers what you need help with.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  <li><strong>Begin getting to know your Writing Group.</strong> Your professional bio draft will be your introduction to your group, but you can also get to know each other by chatting in the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/discussion_topics/363964" target="_blank">Group Chat Discussion in Canvas</a>.
