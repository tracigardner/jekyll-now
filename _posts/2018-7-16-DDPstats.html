Use this information to understand the expectations for commenting on the Daily Discussion Posts, but remember that the numbers here are for a 15-week semester (not a summer term).</p>
<h2>General Advice</h2>
<p>Think of responding to the discussion posts like participating in a course that meets in the classroom. Chime in when you have something to say, but don't feel compelled to talk just for the sake of talking.  </p>
<h2>Counting Your  Comments</h2>
<p>As long as you did not post as a guest and you verified your account, you can see the number of comments you have made by clicking on your name in the heading to any comment you have made. The comment tool we are using will show you a summary as well as the text of your comments: </p>

<p>This summary will be useful when you work on your final exam. If you need help with the commenting system, see <a href="https://help.disqus.com/commenting/commenting-101" target="_blank">Commenting 101</a>.</p>
<h2>Details on the Stats</h2>
<p>The infographic on the right shows some stats on the comments from the Fall 2017 Semester to help you gauge what's typical. The numbers are for four sections of the course, which works out to 88 students. </p>
<p>Out of the 88 students in the course, 61 of them commented at least once. That works out to about seven students out of every ten.</p>
<p>The highest number of comments by a student was 61. The average number of comments per student was 18. There were a total of 66 Daily Discussion Posts and a total of 1091 comments for the entire semester.</p>
<p>Those who posted more comments tended to do better in the course; but posting more is not a guarantee of an A. You have to meet all the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/" target="_blank">Requirements</a> in the course.</p>
