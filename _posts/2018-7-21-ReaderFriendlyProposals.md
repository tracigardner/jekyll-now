<p>Today’s #WeekendWatch demonstrates how <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Business-Communication-tutorials/Constructing-reader-friendly-design/182920/410263-4.html?org=vt.edu" target="_blank">Reader-Friendly Design</a> (4m40s) can improve a proposal, making it more likely that readers will consider the document fully. </p>
<p>The video shows a before and after version of a chunk of text from a proposal and walks through the changes that make the revised document easier to read. The video shows why it’s important to pay attention to paragraphing, headings, and document structures (like bullet lists) for a reader-friendly design.</p>
<p>Watch the video for more information on strategies that you can apply in your short proposal.</p>
