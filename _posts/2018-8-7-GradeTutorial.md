<p>For your <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/assignments/442794" target="_parent">final exam</a>, you will write a self-evaluation that tells me what grade you deserve in the course. In the workplace, this process would be similar to asking for a raise or some additional perk during your annual review.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll determine the course grade you deserve by returning to the <a href="https://canvas.vt.edu/courses/70739/pages/syllabus" target="_parent">syllabus</a> and <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/" target="_parent">requirements</a> page on this site. First, remember that your grades in this course are based 100% on the labor you actively contributed to building and supporting the writing community and the labor you put into completing all the activities and projects in the course. In your final exam, you will present the details on what you have done and avoid making excuses or telling &ldquo;sob stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember that the Grades in Canvas are only a summary of the work that you completed (or did not complete). Your grade is based on your work as outlined on the <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/" target="_parent">requirements</a> page.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="lower">To Earn a Grade Lower than a B</h2>
<p>If you did not complete all of the activities in the section above, your grade will be lower than a B. Discuss the required work that you did complete, explaining how much of it you completed. You can also refer to any work that you did beyond the basic requirements.</p>
<p>In your final exam, tell me what grade you deserve in the course (B-, C+, D, etc.), using the information from your performance evaluation to support your argument.</p>
<h2 id="higher">To Earn a Grade Higher than a B</h2>
<p><img src="https://tracigardner.github.io/wp-content/uploads/gradedApaper-233x300-1-233x300.png" alt="Paper Graded A" width="233" height="300" style="float: right;" />You must have taken an ongoing leadership role by helping to share new ideas with the class and significantly adding support to the writing community.</p>
<p>Your contributions may have been supportive actions that you designed yourself (with feedback from me) or actions that came from <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/#higher">a list of possible suggestions</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>Be sure to talk about consistency.</strong> Your argument is stronger if you  demonstrate that you consistently worked toward your goal during the entire term, rather than waiting until the last minute. </p>
<p>Grades higher than a B are based on the value of those contributions to demonstrating your leadership and adding support to the writing community. They are  not based on the number of contributions you make, but upon how effective your contributions are.</p>
