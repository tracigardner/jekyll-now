<h1 id="top">How Canvas Grades Work</h1>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/gradebook.jpg" alt="Grade book by David Mulder on Flickr, used under a CC-BY-SA 2.0 license" width="403" height="302" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4085" />I use Canvas Grades differently from the way most teachers do, so I want to explain how it works. </p>
<h2 id="whatistracked">What Is Tracked in Canvas Grades</h2>
<p>Canvas  only tracks what you have done and what you have not done. It’s not calculating your course grade. </p>
<p>As explained in the <a href="/syllabus/#top">Syllabus</a> and on the <a href="/requirements/#top">Requirements</a> page, your grade in this course is based on labor, on the work you put into the course. There are essentially three categories your work can fall into:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>If you complete <a href="/requirements/#courserequirements">the required activities</a>, you will earn a B in the course.
  </li>
  <li>If you do not complete the required activities, you will earn less than a B in the course.</li>
  <li>If you complete <a href="/requirements/#higher">additional work</a>, you will earn a grade higher than a B in the course.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the work you do in the course earns either a Complete or an Incomplete. In Quizzes, your Course Declarations indicate how much of the available work you have completed, according to your own self-reporting: </p>
<ul>
  <li>An 85 means you have completed all of  <a href="/requirements/#courserequirements">the required activities</a>.</li>
  <li>An 86 or higher means  you have completed all of  <a href="/requirements/#courserequirements">the required activities</a> plus some <a href="/requirements/#higher">additional work</a> toward a grade higher than a B in the course.</li>
  <li>An 84 or lower means  you have not  completed all of <a href="/requirements/#courserequirements">the required activities</a>.</li>
  <li>A zero (0) means you did not attempt the quiz at all.</li>
</ul>
Because Canvas Grades is a computer program, it will provide you a Total calculation at the bottom of the list. Remember that  calculation doesn’t matter. Canvas doesn’t have a way to calculate your grade in this labor-based system.
<h2 id="completesvincompletes">Completes vs. Incompletes</h2>
<p>Canvas Grades tracks the Complete and Incomplete status of your work with icons. Here’s a screenshot of the Grades for an Example Student:</p>

</figure>
<p>As shown under the <strong>Score</strong> column in the image, a checkmark <i class="fa fa-check fa-3"></i> means that the work is Complete. An <strong>X</strong> mark in the <strong>Score</strong> column means that the work is Incomplete. It doesn’t desginate that anything is wrong for most people. As long as you have submitted your work, the <strong>X</strong> mark tells you that you need to revise. </p>
<p>If you did not submit your work by the end of the grace period however, the <strong>X</strong> mark indicates that fact. In these cases, you cannot revise.  Unlimited, punishment-free revisions are NOT intended to support those who never did the work in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="howyouredoing">How to Tell How You're Doing</h2>
<p>If you have submitted all the work that is required, you are on track to earn at least a B in the course. Even if you have an Incomplete on a Major Project or a Labor Log,  you are still on track to earn at least a B in the course. As long as you are putting in your best effort, you don’t need to worry.</p>
<p>If you’d like confirmation, look at Grades in Canvas for one of these indications:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Look at the <strong>Score</strong> column in the light gray list of activities at the top of the table. If you see 100s, checkmarks, and X marks, you are on track to at least a B in the course.</li>
  <li>Find the categories  followed by an asterisk (<strong>*</strong>) in the medium gray list at the bottom of the table (marked on the Screenshot above). Look at the <strong>Score</strong> column for those categories, which are required for a B. If you see 100% for those categories,  you are on track to at least a B in the course.</li>
  <li> If you do not see 100% for the required categories, look at the <strong>Out of</strong> column in the medium gray area to tell how far off you are. If you see 200/300, for instance, you’ll know that just one thing is missing (so you are still likely to be on track for at least a B in the course).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working toward a grade higher than a B, pay attention to how many of the <a href="/requirements/#higher">additional contributions listed on the Requirements page</a> you have completed. </p>
