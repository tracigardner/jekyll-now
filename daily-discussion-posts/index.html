<h1>Daily Discussion Posts</h1>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/Winn_Army_Community_Hospital_Pharmacy_Stays_Online_During_Power_Outage-1024x612.jpg" alt="Winn Army Community Hospital Pharmacy Stays Online During Power Outage by MC4 Army on Flickr, used under a CC-BY 2.0 license" width="399" height="239" class="alignright" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 9px;" />Every Tuesday through Saturday during the course, I’ll post advice articles, how-to webpages, relevant infographics, and other resources that supplement the regular work of the course. The idea is to share additional readings that will help you in the workplace. These posts  meet three goals:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>to give you information that relates directly to projects you are already working on.</li>
  <li>to cover topics important to workplace writing that we are not covering in the major projects.</li>
  <li>to share resources that help with writing generally (such as writing strong sentences or techniques for document design).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="categories">What I Will Post</h2>
<p>These Daily Discussion Posts are organized around a series of hashtags: </p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li><strong>#TuesdayTutorial</strong><br />
    These posts either demonstrate something or tell you how to do something. They may explain how to write a specific thing (like a memo) or how to revise something you have already written (like revising for concise phrasing).
  </li>
  <li><strong>#WednesdayWrite</strong><br />
  Each post asks you to consider how you would handle a specific situation in the workplace or in the course. As an example, you might consider an ethical scenario and discuss the various options available.</li>
  <li><strong>#InfographicInspiration</strong> (on Thursdays)<br />
  Every post will present an infographic about communication and writing in the workplace. Some will provide information a particular kind of writing while others will offer general writing tips.</li>
  <li><strong>#FridayFact</strong><br />
    These posts will share a specific fact about writing in the workplace, which you can compare to what you know about your field. Usually these facts have an accompanying article that supports the fact.
  </li>
  <li><strong>#WeekendWatch</strong><br />
  Every weekend post (usually on Saturdays) will share a video that presents something relevant to what we are covering in class or something else related to writing in the workplace.</li>
</ul>
<p>There may be other kinds of posts, of course. Sometimes there will be announcements about something important or something that needs to be clarified or changed, for instance. </p>
<h2 id="grades">How Do These Posts Work With Grades</h2>
<p>These additional posts supplement the projects that you are working on. I encourage everyone to read through them, especially since they frequently relate directly to the projects you are working on. They're short. I believe most of them will take 2 to 3 minutes at most. Some may take a bit longer, especially the videos you can watch.</p>
<p>Responding to these posts is completely optional. You decide whether to participate and how to participate. If you are working toward a <a href="/requirements/#higher">grade higher than a B in the course</a>, you can respond to these messages as part of the extra work you do to build community in the course and share ideas. Responding to these Daily Discussion Posts is  just one of several options.</p>
<h2 id="responding">How To Respond to the Posts</h2>
<p>Responding should be relatively easy. If you can comment on YouTube videos or Facebook posts, you will do fine responding to these posts. </p>
<p><strong>What tool are we using for comments? </strong>You will post your comments using the Disqus commenting system. This system is used by many popular websites, including TMZ, Rolling Stone, The Chronicle of Higher Ed, and The Atlantic.</p>
<p><strong>What should you write in response?</strong> Respond with significant, well-explained comments. This is not the place for “yeah, I agree” or “me too” kinds of comments. Instead, aim to contribute ideas, engage with others, and extend the conversation.</p>
<p> <strong>How do you respond?</strong> Use  the comment form at the bottom of the posts. You do not have to enter your real name. I understand that you may not want to have your name come up in a Google search. You can connect to the commenting tool using one of the available options (e.g., Facebook, Google), or you can create a new login. You can also post as a guest, but your comment will then have to be approved before it appears on the site. Additionally, the number of comments that you make will not be tracked if you post as a guest. Remember to keep track of your comments in your <a href="/requirements/labor-log/">Labor Log</a>.</p>
<p><strong>When will your comment appear?</strong> Registered users on Disqus must <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/960202-verifying-your-disqus-account">verify</a> their email address prior to posting a comment. All guest comments have to be moderated, so they will be delayed in appearing. If the site begins to have a problem with spam, all comments may be moderated.</p>
