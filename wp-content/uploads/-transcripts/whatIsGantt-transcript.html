<h1>What Is a Gantt Chart?</h1>

<h2>What is this sorcery?</h2>
<p>A type of bar chart to illustrate how long a project and its tasks will take. Useful for planning projects and scheduling all tasks, resources, and milestones. Through Gantt charts, teams can define problems visually, and better work out solutions.</p>

<h2>Timeline of the Gantt Chart</h2>
<p>Joseph Priestly – 1765: Joseph Priestly makes the first known bar charts in his “Chart of Biography,” which plots the lifetimes of 2,000 celebrities on a timeline.(3) The precursor to Gantt charts.</p>

<p>William Playfair – 1786: William Playfair develops a range of statistical graphics including: bar graphs, line graphs, and pie charts. Uses it in his <i>Commercial and Political Atlas</i>.(3) Another precursor to Gantt charts.</p>

<p>Karol Adamiecki – 1896: Polish management researcher Karol Adamiecki invents the theory of work harmonization, which uses a graphic chart called the <b>Harmonogram</b>, meant for creating visual solutions to production problems. It causes a stir in Russian technical circles.(1)</p>

<p>Henry L. Gantt – 1910-1915: American engineer Henry L. Gantt invents the <b>Gantt General Control Production Chart</b>, used to plan and manage batch production in machine shops. Unlike European bar charts, his are able to track if projects are done on time.(2)</p>

<p>1917-1918: Gantt’s charts are used to oversee production of small arms and ammunition, as well as commercial shipping efforts for World War I, supporting General William Crozier.(3)</p>

<p>1923: The term “Gantt chart” is first used in Wallace Clark’s book <i>The Gantt Chart, A Working Tool of Management</i>.(3)</p>

<p>1931-1936: Gant charts used to supervise the building of the Hoover Dam on the border between U.S. states Arizona and Nevada.</p>

<p>1956-1991: Gantt charts help manage the construction of the interstate highway system in the U.S.</p>

<p>1980s: Gant charts experience a sudden resurgence in fame thanks to the birth of the software development industry and programming.</p>


<h2>Anatomy of a Gantt Chart</h2>
<p>Timeline: Shows hours, days, weeks, months, quarters</p>

<p>Vertical Red Line: Indicates current date</p>

<p>Arrows: Show how tasks are dependent on one another</p>

<p>Milestone: Shows the due date of a project or end of important project phase</p>

<p>Bar Color: In Wrike, blue tasks are active, red tasks are overdue, green tasks are completed</p>

<p>Bars: Show full duration of a task</p>



<h2>5 Benefits of Gantt Charts</h2>
<p>One View: Complex project? Lots of tasks? Distill them into one view and get everyone on the same page.</p>

<p>Grasp Dependencies: See how tasks are related, and whether a task needs a previous to-do to be completed (or started) before going forward.</p>

<p>Resource Usage: View which resources have been allocated and which are free to better manage costs, personnel, time, and venues.</p>

<p>Clear Scheduling: Deadlines are obvious. Every delay moves the plan back, with setbacks represented visually. Everyone knows exactly what needs to be done to keep your project on schedule.</p>

<p>Transparency: Seeing who does which task – and where your progress stands – makes everyone accountable. Visibility makes it easier for team members to work together, share ideas, and lend each other a helping hand.</p>
