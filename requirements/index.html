<h1 id="top">Requirements</h1>
<p>Your grades in this course are based 100% on your labor as you  complete all the required activities and projects in the course and actively contribute to a supportive writing community.</p>
 <h2 id="labor">Labor in This Course</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/roadwork-noun_93997_cc-257x300-257x300.png" alt="Crew Working by Iris Sun from the Noun Project" width="257" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-3521" style="margin-left: 15px;margin-bottom: 9 px;" />In the workplace, you will be assessed by how hard you work and what you accomplish. Managers rarely give letter grades. They expect you to show up, put in your best effort, and accomplish the goals your company sets. If you do nothing or the bare minimum,  you will be reprimanded or fired. </p>
<p>Grades in this course are based on a similar system. You earn your grade based on your labor—on the time and intensity that you put into your writing and collaboration. You are not punished for making mistakes as long as you work to improve throughout the term.</p>
<p>The labor in this course includes the following:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li><em>Reading, Listening, and Viewing</em><br />
    You will read, listen to, and/or view texts including ebooks, websites, images, and videos. There will be explanations and how-to texts as well as examples and inspirational texts. You will also read, listen to, and/or view texts written by members of your writing group and others in the class.</li>
  <li><em>Writing</em><br />
    You will write drafts, revisions, and updates for all the major projects in this course. You will also write professional messages to one another and to me, respond to specific questions and discussions, and keep a written record of your work in the course.<br />
  </li>
  <li><em>Providing &amp; Responding to Feedback</em><br />
    You will provide formative feedback on the writing done by members of your writing group and others in the class. You will also receive feedback on your own writing and respond to that feedback by asking for questions or clarification and by using the feedback to improve your work.</li>
  <li><em>Reflecting</em><br />
    You will review your work in the course and reflect upon how you have done and what you can do to improve further. Your reflection will consider all of the work you do in the course.</li>
  <li><em>Collaborating</em><br />
  You will work with  your writing group to plan your projects and  keep on schedule. You will work together throughout the course, with every team member contributing equally. Your collaborative efforts will help build a supportive writing community in this course, as you  help the members of your writing group and others in the class with the activities and projects in the course. </li>
</ul>
<p>This grading system is probably not what you are used to, so I have created a separate page that explains <a href="https://www.tracigardner.com/labor" target="_blank">how you should approach your work</a> in a course where your grades are based on labor. Perhaps the most important take-away is that going through the motions won’t work. You must engage deeply in the course, working consistently to improve your writing and collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="courserequirements">Course Requirements</h2>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/gradedBpaper.jpg" alt="Graded Paper, which has earned a B" width="258" height="331" class="alignright size-full wp-image-3649" />As long as you do the work that is required, you will <strong>earn a B in this course</strong>. Specifically, you must complete these requirements:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
  <li>Earn a Complete on <a href="/requirements/major-projects/#top">five assigned major projects</a> (uploaded as  Assignments in Canvas).</li>
  <li>Record and reflect on your work in the course in a <a href="/requirements/labor-log/#top">Labor Log</a> (using a word processor or spreadsheet, uploaded as an Assignment in Canvas).</li>
  <li>Share all five major projects with your writing group, and provide <a href="/requirements/writing-groups/#top">formative feedback</a> on the major project drafts that are submitted by the members of  your writing group (entered in Discussions in Canvas).</li>
  <li>Track the work you have completed (no partial credit; the assignment must be finished) for the course in Course Declarations (entered as true/false Quizzes in Canvas).</li>
  <li>Evaluate your labor in the course in <a href="/requirements/final-exam/#top">a performance review</a>, which serves as your final exam (uploaded as an Assignment in Canvas).</li>
</ul>

 <p>If you do not meet these requirements fully, you will <strong>earn a grade lower than a B</strong>. How much lower than a B depends upon how much of the work you do. Your course declarations are the best way to tell if you are not meeting the basic requirements for a B. If you are not marking all of the basic work as complete in these quizzes, you are not meeting the basic requirements.</p>
<p id="higher">To <strong>earn a grade greater than a B</strong>, you must take an ongoing leadership role by helping to teach the class new things and significantly adding support to the writing community. Your contributions can be supportive actions that you design yourself (with feedback and approval from me) or actions that come from a list of possible suggestions, such as the following:</p>
<ul class="listDS">
   <li>complete  peer reviews for people not in your writing group (entered in Discussions in Canvas).</li>
   <li>organize and/or participate in real-time meetings with 4 people or more to share work and provide feedback, or to discuss topics related to the course (using Zoom or Google Hangouts, or meeting face-to-face on campus).</li>
   <li><a href="/daily-discussion-posts/#top">respond with significant, well-explained comments</a> to  the Daily Discussion Posts (on the course home in Canvas). Aim to contribute ideas, engage with others, and extend the conversation (using the comment form on the posts).</li>
   <li>complete the SPOT survey to provide feedback on the course. </li>
 </ul>
