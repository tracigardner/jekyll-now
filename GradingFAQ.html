<div class="container" style="margin-left: 6px;">
<h2><a href="#whylabor" data-toggle="collapse">Why do you use a labor-based system?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="whylabor" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/labor-computer.png" alt="Worker, wearing hard hat, at a computer" style="width: 106px;height: 150px;float: right;" />I believe that a system that allows you to keep working until you get the results that fit the workplace is more humane than a system that punishes you if you aren’t perfect on the first try. </p>
<p>I  know there are lots of situations in the workplace that require perfection. If you submit a bid to a client that has errors, for instance, you may not get a second chance—but that’s in the workplace. You are still in the classroom. </p>
<p>The labor-based system allows you the chance to  learn and improve. You can make mistakes and try again. You can take risks, and if they don’t turn out, your grade will still be okay.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#workplace" data-toggle="collapse">How does this system relate to the workplace?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="workplace" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/workplace.png" alt="Drawing of a building in the background, with a briefcase in the foreground" width="159" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4791" />I have worked in quite a few places, and in none of them did I ever receive a letter grade for the work that I did. Never ever. It just doesn’t work that way.</p>
<p>Sure my writing was read by others I worked with. Sometimes it was good enough to go out to the intended reader right away. Other times it had to be revised first. Grades just weren’t part of the system. </p>
<p>In the workplace, you are assessed on how hard you work and what you accomplish. Managers expect you to show up, put in your best effort, and accomplish the goals your company sets. If you do nothing or the bare minimum, you will be reprimanded or fired.</p>
<p>Grades in this course are based on a similar system. You earn your grade based on your labor—on the time and intensity that you put into your writing and collaboration. You are not punished for making mistakes as long as you work to improve throughout the term.</p>

<h2><a href="#research" data-toggle="collapse">What's the research behind this system?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="research" class="collapse"><p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/research.png" alt="Research article with a magnifying glass" width="165" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4794" />I adapted this strategy from Asao Inoue’s work on <a href="https://www.academia.edu/12029467/Grading_Contracts_Assessing_Their_Effectiveness_on_Different_Racial_Formations" target="_blank">contract grading</a>, <a href="http://www.academia.edu/12027143/A_Grade-less_Writing_Course_that_Focuses_on_Labor_and_Assessing" target="_blank">labor-based grading</a>, and <a href="http://www.academia.edu/14213706/Antiracist_Writing_Assessment_Ecologies_Teaching_and_Assessing_for_a_Socially_Justice_Future" target="_blank">anti-racist assessment strategies</a>. </p>
<p>You can find additional publications on anti-racist assessment and on grading students&rsquo; labor on <a href="http://tacoma-washington.academia.edu/AsaoInoue" target="_blank">Inoue’s Academia.edu page</a>.</p></span>
</div>
<h2><a href="#better" data-toggle="collapse">Why is this system better for students?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="better" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/growth.png" alt="Bar graph showing upward trend" width="170" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4798" />The most important benefits of this system are explained in the <a href="https://tracigardner.com/labor" target="_blank">When Your Grades Are Based on Labor infographic</a>. To summarize those benefits, a labor-based grading system allows you to </p>
<ol>
  <li>Focus on Ideas (Not Mistakes).</li>
  <li>Write for Yourself (Not for Me).</li>
  <li>Take Risks (Don&rsquo;t Play It Safe).</li>
  <li>Have Do-Overs (No Penalty).</li>
</ol>
<p>This labor-based system allows you to continue working on your projects until your work reaches the level that would be acceptable in the workplace. Your grade is not effected by what you haven’t learned yet, and you are free to try out ideas as you like.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#partial" data-toggle="collapse">Why is there no partial credit?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="partial" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/binary.png" alt="Icon for a text file with binary code as the content" width="123" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4802" />Work in this class is either ready to use in the workplace (and graded Complete) or it’s not ready (and graded Incomplete).</p>
<p>Think of it as a binary system. There can only be 1 or 0, Complete or Incomplete.  There isn’t any middle ground, so there isn’t  partial credit. </p>
<p>The thing to remember is that when a project is returned as Incomplete, you can always revise it until you do have a piece that is ready to use in the workplace. There is no punishment in the system if your work isn’t quite ready, but there’s no credit either.</p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#laborlogs" data-toggle="collapse">How are labor logs part of this system?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="laborlogs" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/journal.png" alt="Journal notebook" width="144" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4804" />You document the time you spend on activities and the level of intensity you put into  your work in your labor log. You can think of tracking your work in your log as a parallel to tracking billing codes for what you do in the workplace. </p>
<p>I have no way of knowing what you are working on or even how much you are working in an online class. In a face-to-face classroom, I would see you working in the classroom. I could tell if you were working intensely, working at an average pace, or not  working at all. Since I cannot see your work myself, I need you to tell me what you’re doing. </p>
<p>Additionally, you will use your labor log to gather details about your work when you write <a href="/requirements/final-exam/">your final exam</a>. Keeping track of what you do in your log is easier than trying to remember the details of what you did at the end of the term.</p></div>
<h2><a href="#peerrev" data-toggle="collapse">Why is there so much emphasis on peer feedback in this system?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="peerrev" class="collapse">
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/peerreview.png" alt="Rectangle, representing a piece of paper, with a speech bubble over it, representing comments on the paper" width="133" height="150" class="alignright size-full wp-image-4808" />In the workplace, you will find yourself reading and commenting on the projects of your coworkers frequently. The peer feedback activities in our class give you the chance to learn more about that process. Writing in the workplace is as much about what you write as it is about how you help others with their writing.</p>
<p>Just as importantly, peer feedback helps you improve your own writing in two ways. First, and maybe most obvious, you get advice on your draft that you can use to revise your document. Second, by reading drafts written by your classmates you can see strategies that will help you improve your own work as well as notice errors that you can later check your own work for. </p>
<p>Naturally, you cannot copy other people’s work; however, you can see useful ideas that you can make your own. For instance, you might read a draft that does a great job with headings. When you return to your own draft, those headings will stick with you, and you can use their example as you revise your own draft.</p>

<h2><a href="#guidelines" data-toggle="collapse">What are the guidelines for the different grade levels in this course?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="guidelines" class="collapse">
<p>Here is an alternative explanation of the guidelines for the different grade levels  in this course. Note that this is the same information as listed on <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/" target="_blank">the Requirements page</a>.</p>
<p>To earn a grade lower than a B, do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>earn a complete on four or fewer of the major writing projects.</li>
  <li>skip one or more of the labor logs.</li>
  <li>skip one or more of the course declarations.</li>
  <li>skip one or more of the peer feedback discussions. </li>
  <li>skip the final exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>To earn a B or higher, at a minimum, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>earn a complete on all five of the major writing projects.</li>
  <li>earn a complete on all six of the labor logs.</li>
  <li>complete all  of the course declarations (you need not earn the max number of points).</li>
  <li>complete all five  of the peer feedback discussions.</li>
  <li>submit  the final exam.</li>
</ul>
<p>To earn a grade higher than a B, do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>satisfy <strong>all</strong> of the requirements for a B (listed above).</li>
  <li>complete peer reviews for people not in your writing group (entered in Discussions in Canvas).</li>
  <li>organize and/or participate in real-time meetings with 4 people or more to share work and provide feedback, or to discuss topics related to the course (using Zoom or Google Hangouts, or meeting face-to-face on campus).</li>
  <li><a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/daily-discussion-posts/">respond with significant, well-explained comments</a> to the Daily Discussion Posts (on the course home in Canvas). Aim to contribute ideas, engage with others, and extend the conversation (using the comment form on the posts). See the Daily Discussion Posts Statistics to gauge the average number of posts and engagement.</li>
  <li>complete the SPOT survey to provide feedback on the course. Save a screenshot of some kind to include in your final exam.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2><a href="#how" data-toggle="collapse">How do I earn an A? (or an A-? or a B-?)<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="xxx" class="collapse">
<p>There is no guaranteed list for “how to earn an A” (or any other grade in this course) because everyone’s path is different. It is completely up to you how you reach a grade level. </p>
<p>There are also no absolutes. Say you failed to earn a Complete on one of the major writing projects, but you commented on an above-average number of discussion posts, completed the SPOT survey, and did all of the other work required to earn a B in the course. Can you still earn a B in the course? Sure. It all depends upon the argument that you make in <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/final-exam/" target="_blank">your final exam</a>. </p>
</div>
<h2><a href="#final" data-toggle="collapse">How does the final exam influence a grade in this course?<i class="fa fa-angle-down fa-fw"></i></a></h2>
<div id="xxx" class="collapse">
<p>Your final exam has a significant impact on your course grade. For your final, you will write a performance review that evaluates your work in the course. You will propose the grade you should receive, using information from your <a href="https://tracigardner.github.io/requirements/labor-log/#top">Labor Log</a> and your Course Declarations to support your recommendation. In the workplace, this report would be similar to an annual self-evaluation.</p>
<p>The document is significant because it is the place where you explain any places that you fell short, the ways that you go beyond the basics, and provide details on whatever I should know (as your teacher/supervisor) about your performance this term.</p>
